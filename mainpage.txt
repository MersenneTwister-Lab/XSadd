 *
 * This is XORSHIFT-ADD pseudorandom number generator(xsadd).
 *
 * This Project provides pseudorandom number generators of the
 * Period 2<sup>128</sup>-1.
 *
 * - XORSHIFT-ADD is based on XORSHIFT developed by George Marsaglia.
 * - The state transition function of XORSHIFT-ADD is little bit simpler
 * than XORSHIFT.
 * - XORSHIFT-ADD has non F2-linear output function, which is additon of
 * unsigned integer modulo 2<sup>32</sup>.
 * - The output function lets XORSHIT-ADD to pass the BigCrush test of
 * TestU01 test suite.
 * - xsadd.c contains jump functions.
 *
 * The following C files are intended to work with C programs written
 * by users.
 * - xsadd.c 32-bit pseudo random number generator's program.
 * - xsadd.h a header file of 32-bit pseudo random number generators.
 *
 * Two executable files and documents are made by typing \b make \b all.
 * - test_xsadd a simple check program for xsadd
 * - The document html files you are looking at.
